# Part of the unattended build configuration for this project for Mac OS

# To do a clean unattended build:

# The default buildshim for $_os is $PATH/bau-defaults/buildshim-$_os
# Projects may override the whole buildshim by providing file ci/buildshim[.$_os]
# or override individual steps by providing file ci/do-$stepname[.$_os].
# Overridden steps can access the variables and functions defined by the default buildshim.
